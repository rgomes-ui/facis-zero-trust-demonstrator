# Admission policy from Git

Gatekeeper decides admission from the constraint templates and constraints present in the cluster,
and cannot fetch them from anywhere itself. Until here they reached a zone by hand:
`scripts/admission/install.sh` applies the files of [deployment/admission](../admission/README.md)
with kubectl, nothing puts a constraint back when it is changed in the cluster, and nothing shows the
drift. This directory makes the path from Git to the cluster real (ZT-12): an Argo CD in every zone
keeps the templates, the exemptions and the constraints equal to the revision the zone follows,
reverts what is changed by hand, and exports the state of the sync.

## Layout: one parent, three children

Argo CD reconciles *Applications*: each names a path in a Git repository at a revision and a
destination, and Argo CD keeps the destination equal to the path. The layout is an app-of-apps:

| Application | Source | What it keeps equal to Git |
|---|---|---|
| `ztd-admission` (parent) | [deployment/helm/admission-gitops](../helm/admission-gitops/README.md), rendered as a Helm chart with the zone's values; in the `ztd-bootstrap` project, which allows it one repository, this namespace, and only Applications and AppProjects | the project and the three children below |
| `admission-templates` (wave 0) | `deployment/admission/templates/` | the ConstraintTemplates, cluster-scoped |
| `admission-exemptions` (wave 0) | `deployment/admission/exemptions.yaml` | Gatekeeper's `Config` in `gatekeeper-system` |
| `admission-constraints` (wave 1) | `deployment/admission/constraints/` (a kustomize base) | the constraints, with the zone's trusted repository prefixes patched into `ztd-allowed-repositories` |

Every one of them syncs automatically, prunes what left Git and heals what was changed in the
cluster (`selfHeal`), so a policy merged to the revision appears in the cluster on the next
reconciliation (at most three minutes, the controller's polling interval plus jitter) and a
hand-edited constraint is put back within seconds of the change being seen. The installer creates
the parent only; the parent renders the rest, so a change to the children is a change to the chart in
Git, never to the cluster.

The children are cut by layer and not one per policy because the order between layers is what
matters: Gatekeeper creates the CRD of each constraint kind from its template, so the constraints
sync after the templates (sync waves on the children, a retry with backoff on the constraints for a
template and its constraint merged together), and the one value that differs per zone, the
repository prefix, lives in one constraint.

An `AppProject`, `ztd-admission`, confines the children: the one source repository, the
`gatekeeper-system` namespace as the only writable one, and only the kinds the policy consists of
(ConstraintTemplate, the constraint kinds, Config). A child cannot be pointed elsewhere by an edit to
a child, since the parent puts the child back.

## One Argo CD per zone

Each zone runs its own Argo CD, reconciling its own cluster through the in-cluster API address, and no
Argo CD holds a credential for another cluster. One instance managing both zones would put the
cluster-admin credential of zone B inside zone A, across the boundary the demonstrator exists to
show (docs/architecture.md, section 6); a zone is also meant to stand on its own. The price is that a
zone is handed its policy once, by the installer, and the two zones follow the same revision because
both are told the same one.

## Policy from the registry

ZT-12 wants the zone to read the policy from the registry, not from Git: Git is where the policy is
authored and reviewed, the registry is where a reviewed, signed package of it is published
([Policy package](../../docs/ci-cd.md#policy-package)), and a zone applies what it can verify was
published. Argo CD reads an `oci://` source by digest, with the same paths the package holds
(`templates/`, `constraints/`, `exemptions.yaml`), but verifies no signature; the puller
([deployment/helm/policy-puller](../helm/policy-puller/README.md)) is the piece between the two.

It is a CronJob in this namespace. Each run, every five minutes:

1. resolves the package's channel tag (`main`, moved by the publication workflow to each digest it
   signs) to the digest it names now;
2. verifies the cosign signature of that digest against the trusted public key, with the admission
   provider's own code (`internal/cosignverify`), and that the manifest is a policy package;
3. refuses a package created before the one the zone already follows: the signature covers the
   manifest's `created` annotation (the commit's time), so a channel tag moved back to an older,
   legitimately signed digest is a rollback, not a release;
4. writes the digest into the parent's values (`package.digest`), from which the parent re-renders
   the three children with `repoURL: oci://<repository>` and `targetRevision: <digest>`.

Only the puller writes the digest, and Argo CD then only reads by digest: a tag can be moved, a
digest cannot. Everything after step 4 is the reconciler as before: the children sync, prune and
self-heal, and the zone's prefix is still patched into the allowed-repositories constraint by the
consumer, never written into the package. A refusal, a tag with nothing at it, or a registry that
cannot be reached changes nothing: the zone keeps the digest it last verified. The run records what
it did on the parent, as `kubectl -n argocd describe application ztd-admission` shows: the
annotations `facis.ztd/policy-digest`, `policy-created`, `policy-verified` and `policy-refused` (the
last refusal, cleared by the next success), and an Event per change or failure
(`PolicyPackageApplied`, `PolicyPackageRefused`, `PolicyPackageUnavailable`).

The puller runs with a ServiceAccount that may `get` and `patch` the one parent Application and
create Events, and reaches the registry through its own egress lane (the registry's port, any
address, as the repo server's Git lane); the lanes to the API server and to DNS it shares with the
namespace. The repo server reads the package over its existing HTTPS lane; a test registry on another
port gets a lane from the installer.

The package is a second source, not a replacement of the chart: the parent still renders
`deployment/helm/admission-gitops` from Git, so the layout of the children is changed by a pull
request, and `package.digest` empty (a zone installed without `POLICY_REPOSITORY`) keeps the
children on Git.

## What runs, and what it may do

The pinned Argo CD chart (`scripts/tools/pins.env`: chart version and SHA-256, images by digest) with
[argocd-values.yaml](argocd-values.yaml): the application controller, the repo server, the API server
and redis. Dex, the notifications and the ApplicationSet controllers are off (the last stays as a
Deployment with zero replicas: the chart has no switch for it). The API server has no users: the admin
account is disabled, no SSO is configured, and the installer deletes the password Secret the server
writes at its first start, so nothing can log in to the UI or the API. The state is read and the
Applications are written with kubectl, as the installer and the checks do.

**Rights.** The chart's default gives the controller `*` on everything. Here the controller reads
everything (its resource cache, and the state it reports) and writes only the three Gatekeeper API
groups the policy consists of; the API server reads only. Argo CD's own objects stay under the
namespaced roles the chart creates.

**Network.** The `argocd` namespace is default-deny in both directions, as every plane namespace of
the umbrella chart is, with these lanes:

| Lane | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ingress, between components | `allow-repo-server-ingress`, `allow-redis-ingress`, `allow-controller-metrics-ingress` | the controller and the API server to the repo server (8081) and redis (6379); the metrics ports (8082, 8084) from any namespace, for the zone's collector |
| ingress, the API server | `allow-server-ingress` | port 8080 from this namespace only, metrics (8083) from any namespace. The chart's own policies are off: its API-server policy admitted ingress from anywhere |
| egress, within the namespace | `allow-intra-namespace-egress` | the same, from the other side |
| egress, DNS | `allow-dns-egress` | to CoreDNS in `kube-system`, ports 53 and 8053 |
| egress, Git | `allow-git-egress` | the repo server only, HTTPS only, anywhere: the repository is on a public host |
| egress, the Kubernetes API | written by the installer | under Cilium (`CILIUM=1`) a CiliumNetworkPolicy to the `kube-apiserver` entity, the only form that selects the API server there; elsewhere a NetworkPolicy to the addresses given (`KUBE_API_CIDRS`: the endpoint of the `kubernetes` Service and its cluster address; kind's CNI enforces policy and needs it, as the e2e script shows). Both open `KUBE_API_PORTS` (default `443,6443`: the Service port and the endpoint port, as the umbrella's lane). On a cluster with Cilium the installer refuses to run without a lane |

On a Gardener cluster the namespace also carries `apiserver-proxy.networking.gardener.cloud/inject=disable`,
as the umbrella's namespaces do: without it the platform points every pod at a node-local proxy that
sits outside the API lane.

**Observability.** The controller exports `argocd_app_info{name, sync_status, health_status, ...}`,
one series per Application, on `argocd-application-controller-metrics:8082/metrics`; the repo server
and the API server export on 8084 and 8083. The metrics Services carry the `prometheus.io/scrape`
annotations, so the zone's collector picks them up once it is installed (ZT-27); until then the
installer reads the series itself and refuses to finish without one `sync_status="Synced"` per
Application.

## Install

After Gatekeeper and the provider (`scripts/admission/install.sh`), with the chart archive from
`scripts/tools/install.sh <dir> argocd-chart`:

```bash
BIN=<dir> TRUST_REPOSITORY=<host/path> CILIUM=1 \
NAMESPACE_LABELS=apiserver-proxy.networking.gardener.cloud/inject=disable \
scripts/argocd/install.sh
```

`TRUST_REPOSITORY` is the zone's trusted repository prefix, the value the provider was installed
with; the installer refuses one that is not among the provider's `trust.repositories`, so the
constraint and the provider cannot disagree. `REPO_URL` and `REVISION` (default: this repository on GitHub, `main`) are what the zone
follows; a pull request is proven on a cluster by pointing a zone at its branch, then re-running the
installer with the defaults once it is merged. The script is idempotent and stops at the first check
that fails: an image not pinned by digest, an Application not `Synced/Healthy`, the zone's prefix
missing from the constraint, or the sync status missing from the metrics.

To read the policy from the registry ([Policy from the registry](#policy-from-the-registry)), add
the package's repository and the puller image:

```bash
BIN=<dir> TRUST_REPOSITORY=<host/path> CILIUM=1 \
NAMESPACE_LABELS=apiserver-proxy.networking.gardener.cloud/inject=disable \
POLICY_REPOSITORY=<registry host>/<path of the policy package> \
PULLER_IMAGE=<repository of the policy-puller image>@sha256:<digest> \
scripts/argocd/install.sh
```

`POLICY_REPOSITORY` is the repository `policy-publish.yml` pushes to (`POLICY_REGISTRY/admission`);
`POLICY_TAG` (default `main`) the channel tag, `TRUST_KEY` (default the committed interim public key)
the key the package must be signed by. The installer declares the repository to Argo CD, installs the
puller, runs it once and finishes only when every child reads the package at the verified digest; a
re-run keeps the digest the zone follows. Without `POLICY_REPOSITORY` the children read Git, and a
zone that read the package goes back to Git.

## Operations

- **Changing the policy** is a pull request to `deployment/admission/`; nothing is applied to a zone
  by hand. `kubectl -n argocd get applications` shows each Application with its sync status and the
  revision it is at.
- **Proving the revert:** `scripts/argocd/drift-check.sh` edits the naming constraint's pattern in
  the cluster and reports the seconds until the value from Git is back; the injected pattern still
  admits the `ztd-` names, and it is live for seconds.
- **Pulling now, and what was pulled:** `kubectl -n argocd create job --from=cronjob/ztd-policy-puller pull-now`
  runs the puller without waiting for the schedule; `kubectl -n argocd describe application ztd-admission`
  shows the digest followed, when it was verified, the last refusal and the puller's Events.
- **Break-glass:** `kubectl -n argocd scale statefulset argocd-application-controller --replicas 0`
  stops reconciliation at once and removes nothing; `--replicas 1` resumes it, and the next
  reconciliation reverts whatever was changed meanwhile.
- **Removing the reconciler.** `kubectl -n argocd delete application ztd-admission` is a cascade: the
  children go, and with them the templates, the constraints and the exemptions they manage, which
  leaves the zone without admission policy. To remove Argo CD and keep the policy in place, remove the
  `resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io` finalizer from the four Applications first, then
  `helm uninstall argocd -n argocd` (the CRDs are kept, `crds.keep`).

## Tests

- `scripts/argocd/kind-e2e.sh`: a throwaway kind cluster with Gatekeeper and Argo CD, handed the
  policy of a Git revision; every Application `Synced/Healthy`, the catalogue in the cluster equal to
  the checkout, the zone's prefix patched in, a hand-edited constraint put back, a hand-edited child
  Application put back by the parent, and the sync status in the metrics. Then the package: the
  catalogue published with the release scripts and an ephemeral key to a registry on the kind
  network, the zone re-installed with `POLICY_REPOSITORY`, every child reading the package by digest
  with the same content; a tampered package at the channel tag refused and the zone unchanged; a
  release signed with the trusted key applied, with its change visible in the cluster; the channel
  tag moved back to the older release refused as a rollback; and a stopped registry changing
  nothing. The `admission-gitops` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs it against the revision under
  test, fetched from the repository it came from.
- `go test ./cmd/policypuller`: the puller against a registry and an API server in the test: a
  verified package applied, one already followed not written again, another key's signature, no
  signature, an older package, a missing `created`, a manifest that is not a policy package and an
  empty tag refused, an unreachable registry reported and nothing changed, and the refusal
  annotation written once and cleared by a success.
- The chart is linted and rendered by the chart gate like every chart under `deployment/helm/`; the
  gate's cluster serves Argo CD's Application and AppProject CRDs for the server dry-run.
