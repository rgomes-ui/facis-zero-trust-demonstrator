# Evidence that the zone's mesh identities are SPIRE's, on the local kind cluster with Cilium
# chained (scripts/dev/kind-cilium-up.sh) or on one of the two participant clusters with the
# provider's Cilium. Installs the zone from an empty cluster with scripts/install-zone/install.sh,
# twice, then proves with stand-in pods: an SVID over the CSI socket, on every node with a SPIRE
# agent too (one unmeshed stand-in per node in spire-system, from fixtures/svid-on-node.yaml), the
# SPIRE server's and the controller-manager's metrics endpoints answering beside the agents'
# loopback ones, the proxy's certificate and root bundle issued by SPIRE, no proxy without the SPIRE
# socket and a certificate from istiod's CA refused by a meshed peer, the proxy's traffic capture
# held at the injector's defaults (the capture rule), the TLS 1.3 minimum of mesh mTLS, an
# unregistered workload cut off, traffic through the proxies, the default deny intact with the
# chained CNI and both control planes inside it, the native-sidecar version rule, the identity-band
# checks, the cluster's CNI left as found, and a teardown that leaves nothing behind (or, on a
# participant cluster with the keep opt-in and every check passed, the record of what stays).
# On a participant cluster every pod the proof creates (the stand-ins, their -capture-check copies,
# the probe of section 8's scratch namespace, the kube-public pod of section 13) is pinned to the
# node istiod runs on, with a required node affinity on kubernetes.io/hostname: the provider's pod
# network masquerades pod traffic between nodes, so the mesh is proven node-locally there until the
# provider changes it. The one exception is the per-node SVID stand-ins, each placed on its own node.
# Kind is not pinned.
# Writes evidence.md and environment.json to a run directory outside the repository (see
# ZTD_EVIDENCE_DIR below) and prints that directory as its last line; it never writes under docs/ or
# anywhere else in the repository, which holds no record of a run. Never run by CI: the evidence is
# the record of a run on a cluster.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-mesh-identity/verify.sh           run the proof: DESTRUCTIVE, it uninstalls the zone
#                                                    from the cluster first and again at the end
#   scripts/verify-mesh-identity/verify.sh --help    this text; touches nothing
# Any other argument prints this text and exits 125 without touching the cluster.
#
# Exit status:
#   0        every check passed
#   1-124    the number of failed checks (capped at 124); the evidence is written
#   125      refused or not run (an argument, CI, the context guard, a run directory inside the
#            repository): nothing written
#   130/143  interrupted (INT/TERM); on a participant cluster the zone is torn down, no evidence
#
# Environment:
#   KUBE_CONTEXT          kubectl context (default: kind-ztd). Accepted: a kind cluster (named
#                         kind-<name>, every node's provider ID kind://...), or the participant
#                         cluster zerotrust-a or zerotrust-b when all of these hold: ZTD_CONFIRM_CLUSTER
#                         equals the context name, the context's API server host begins with
#                         api.<context>., every node's provider ID begins with onmetal:// and every
#                         node name contains --<context>-. Anything else is refused (exit 125) before
#                         the cluster is read or written.
#   ZTD_CONFIRM_CLUSTER   on a participant cluster: the context name, typed for this run
#   ZTD_KEEP_ZONE         on a participant cluster: the context name to leave the zone installed when
#                         every check passed (the teardown is replaced by the record of what remains);
#                         unset, a failed check or an interrupted run tears the zone down. Refused on

#   ZTD_EVIDENCE_DIR      the run directory: created if missing, used as given, refused inside the
