# Publish a policy package (policy-package.sh): push the tarball as one OCI artefact - a single layer of
# the media type Argo CD reads from an oci:// source, with the annotations that tie it to the commit it
# came from - then sign the manifest by digest with the release signing profile (cosign v2 classic
# layout, key-based, no transparency log: the profile of sign-attest.sh) and verify the signature
# against the committed public key. The last line printed is the digest reference, the one thing a
# consumer pins: the tag is where to look, the digest is what was signed.
#
#   COSIGN_KEY=<key file or env://VAR> [COSIGN_PASSWORD=...] [PUBLIC_KEY=docs/contracts/keys/interim-cosign.pub] \
#   [REGISTRY_USER=... REGISTRY_PASSWORD=...] [SOURCE_URL=<repository url>] [CREATED=<RFC 3339>] \
#   [CHANNEL=main] [ORAS=oras] [COSIGN=cosign] \
#     scripts/supplychain/policy-publish.sh <package.tar.gz> <registry/repository> <version> <revision>
#
# CHANNEL is a second tag moved to the digest once it is signed and verified: the one a zone's puller
# follows (deployment/helm/policy-puller), since version tags have no order a consumer could pick the
# newest by. It is a pointer and nothing more: the signature is on the digest, and the puller verifies
# what the tag points at, never the tag.
#
# REGISTRY_USER and REGISTRY_PASSWORD are the registry credential (a robot account). They are written
# to a Docker config private to this run, which oras and cosign both read, rather than given to
# `docker login`: a login first asks the registry for a token with no scope, and a registry that grants
# a robot account its repositories by scope can refuse that request while refusing nothing the push
# needs. Without them the tools read the ambient Docker config.
#
# CREATED pins the created annotation (oras writes the time of the push otherwise), so a package
# published twice from the same files has the same manifest digest. PLAIN_HTTP=true lets oras and
# cosign reach a plain-http test registry by name (the CI cases); a release never sets it.
