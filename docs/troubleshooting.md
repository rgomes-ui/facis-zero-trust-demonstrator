# Troubleshooting

Symptoms, causes and checks for the demonstrator.

## Reading a refusal

The demonstrator is built so that a refusal explains itself. Before debugging, read the denial: the
guard returns the layer and the rule that produced the decision, and the matching audit entry
carries the same reason code. A refusal with a reason is working as designed — the question is
whether the reason is the one you expected.

## Workload identity and mesh enrolment

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| A pod starts but no traffic reaches it | It never received an SVID, so the mesh has no identity to route to | Look for a SPIRE registration entry matching the pod's service account; a missing entry is the answer, not a mesh problem |
| The SVID exists but the SPIFFE ID is wrong | The registration selector matches more, or less, than intended | Compare the SPIFFE ID in the workload's certificate with the selector that produced it |
| Traffic works between two pods that should not be able to talk | L7 enforcement is owned by neither component on that path, or by both | Check which component owns L7 for that path in the mesh configuration — [ADR-0009](adr/0009-service-mesh-mode-istio-sidecar-with-cilium.md) requires exactly one: where the sidecar enforces L7, Cilium is held to L3/L4 |
| The Istio CNI plugin never chains | Cilium claimed the CNI configuration exclusively | Confirm Cilium is installed with `cni.exclusive=false` |
| A meshed pod stays `Init:1/2`, its application container never starts, and its proxy holds no workload certificate | The pod has no SPIRE entry: it lacks the label `spiffe.io/spire-managed-identity: "true"`, or its namespace lacks the plane label, so the native sidecar never becomes ready under STRICT | `istioctl proxy-config secret <pod> -n <ns>` shows no `default` entry; the proxy logs `workload is not authorized for the requested identities ["default"]`; `spire-server entry show` lists no entry with `k8s:pod-uid:<pod uid>`. Add the label; never relax STRICT |
| The proxy has a `default` certificate but no `ROOTCA`, and every mTLS handshake fails validation | The SPIRE agent serves no resource under the name the proxy asks for its validation context: the SDS names of the `spire` release were changed | `istioctl proxy-config secret <pod>` lists `default` and no `ROOTCA`; the `spire-agent` ConfigMap must hold `sds` with `default_svid_name` `default`, `default_all_bundles_name` `ROOTCA` and `default_bundle_name` `null` ([the SDS contract](workload-identity.md#the-sds-contract)) |
| A pod is stuck in `ContainerCreating` with `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume … csi.spiffe.io` | The SPIRE agent or the SPIFFE CSI driver is not Ready on that node, so the socket cannot be mounted yet | `kubectl -n spire-system get pods -o wide` for the agent and the CSI driver on the pod's node; the agent's log names an attestation failure (for example the server unreachable on 8081, which is the `identityServer` opening) |
| The umbrella refuses to render: `mesh.mode sidecar needs Cilium (cni.cilium.enabled)` | The zone file sets `cni.cilium.enabled: false` while the mesh runs, so the control-plane openings by entity cannot be rendered | The zone's CNI is not Cilium: a declared derogation of the preferred stack is needed before that zone is installed ([Workload identity](workload-identity.md#openings-under-the-default-deny)); on a Cilium cluster, correct the zone file |
| A `ClusterSPIFFEID` or `PeerAuthentication` is refused with `failed calling webhook … context deadline exceeded` | The API server cannot reach the webhook pod under the default deny | `cilium-dbg monitor --type drop` on the webhook pod's node shows the dropped SYN and its source identity; the `controlPlaneWebhooks` opening admits `kube-apiserver`, `host` and `remote-node` on the webhook port |
| The `istio-cni-node` pods crash with `couldn't initialize inotify: too many open files` | On kind, the host's inotify instance limit, shared by every kind node; on another cluster, the node's own limit | On kind: `sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances`; raise it to 512 (`sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=512`), the value kind's known issues give. Elsewhere, read it on every node through its Cilium agent: `kubectl -n kube-system exec <cilium pod> -c cilium-agent -- cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances` (the participant clusters run 8192); a provider-managed node is raised by the provider, not by hand |
| Meshed pods on a node other than istiod's never start on a provider cluster: they stay in `Init:1/2`, their `istio-proxy` never ready, while pods on istiod's node start | Their proxies cannot reach istiod on 15012. The provider's pod network masquerades pod-to-pod traffic between nodes (Cilium in native routing with the pod ranges outside `ipv4-native-routing-cidr`, masquerading on, as on the participant clusters today): the destination sees the node, not the pod, and no policy admitting pods by namespace matches | `cilium-dbg monitor --type drop` on istiod's node (read-only `kubectl exec` into its Cilium pod) shows SYNs to 15012 from node addresses; the proof's preconditions record the routing as found (the pod ranges against the native-routing range). The fix is the provider's: keep pod addresses between nodes (the pod ranges inside the native-routing range, or an overlay); do not widen the lanes to node addresses; no workload lane admits a pod by address (the one address the chart admits is the kubelet probe address of the parked ambient mode, rendered only in that mode). Until then the proof pins its pods to istiod's node there ([OSC guide](environments/osc.md#what-has-been-run)) |
| `verify-mesh-identity: refusing context '<context>'` | The proof accepts a kind cluster, or the participant cluster `zerotrust-a` or `zerotrust-b` behind its opt-in; the message names the fact that did not hold (`ZTD_CONFIRM_CLUSTER`, the API host prefix `api.<context>.`, a node's `onmetal://` provider ID or `--<context>-` name, the zone file's `zone.name`, or `ZTD_KEEP_ZONE` on kind or with another value) | Set the variable it names for this run, or check that the context points at the cluster its name says ([verify-mesh-identity](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/facis-zero-trust-demonstrator/tree/main/scripts/verify-mesh-identity)) |
| A participant-cluster run with `ZTD_KEEP_ZONE` ends with `Zone kept: no` | A check failed (the evidence counts them), so the run tore the zone down as without the opt-in; an interrupted run does the same from its exit trap | Read the failed checks in `evidence.md` of the run directory the run printed as its last line (see `scripts/verify-mesh-identity/README.md`), fix, and re-run; to debug by hand, install with `scripts/install-zone/install.sh` and remove it with `install.sh uninstall` and `kubectl delete namespace ztd-system` |
| A pod in a plane namespace is refused with `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy 'proxy-takes-spire-socket' … denied request` | The pod names its own injection templates (`inject.istio.io/templates`), or has a mesh proxy (a container named `istio-proxy`, running the `proxyv2` image, or naming `pilot-agent`) that does not mount the SPIRE socket; that proxy would take a certificate from istiod's CA instead of SPIRE | The message names which rule refused it. Remove the annotation, any `istio-proxy` override and any container of your own that runs `proxyv2` or `pilot-agent` from the pod template; the default injection already carries the socket ([the proxy](workload-identity.md#the-proxy)) |
| A pod in a plane namespace is refused with `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy 'proxy-takes-spire-socket' … denied request: capture rule` | The pod's capture annotations differ from the injector's defaults, or it carries an outbound or interface exclusion, `status.sidecar.istio.io/port`, `proxy.istio.io/config`, a proxy image, bootstrap or volume annotation, `proxy.istio.io/overrides` (its own `istio-proxy` container), or, in a namespace with the injection label, the injection opt-out `sidecar.istio.io/inject` (annotation or label); any of these would let traffic reach or leave the application outside its proxy, or replace the proxy | First, if every injected pod is refused, the two status ports differ: `zone-policy` `proxySocketPolicy.statusPort` must equal `istiod` `global.proxy.statusPort` (both `15020` by default). Otherwise remove the capture and proxy annotations and the opt-out from the pod template; an exception is declared mesh-wide in the charts, never per pod ([the capture rule](workload-identity.md#the-capture-rule)) |
| A pod in a plane namespace is refused with `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy 'proxy-takes-spire-socket' … denied request: proxy rule` | A mesh proxy of the pod is not the injector's `istio-proxy`: a second proxy under another name, a proxy in a namespace without the injection label, another image, a command, arguments other than the injector's, `envFrom`, an environment variable the injector does not write (such as `ISTIO_BOOTSTRAP_OVERRIDE`) or one at another value (`PROXY_CONFIG` other than `{}`), a volume mount the injector does not write, or a lifecycle hook, probe or `securityContext` other than the injector's (including `sidecar.istio.io/capNetBindService: "true"`, which runs the proxy as root) | First, if every injected pod is refused, the two proxy images differ: `zone-policy` `proxySocketPolicy.proxyImage` must equal `istiod` `global.proxy.image` (`scripts/install-zone/install.sh` refuses such a zone before it installs). Otherwise remove the pod's own proxy container, `proxyv2` or `pilot-agent` container, or a pre-set `sidecar.istio.io/status` annotation ([the capture rule](workload-identity.md#the-capture-rule)) |
| `install-zone: the zone file sets mesh.revision "<revision>"` (or `mesh.mode "<mode>"`), `but this installer installs the default, unrevisioned istiod in sidecar mode only`, and nothing is rendered or installed | The zone file asks for a revisioned mesh or for a mode other than sidecar (ambient, or `none`), which `scripts/install-zone/install.sh` does not install; the umbrella would otherwise label the plane namespaces for an injector that never comes | Set `mesh.mode: sidecar` and remove `mesh.revision` from the zone file; a zone without a mesh (`none`, such as the IONOS zone) installs the umbrella alone through `scripts/lifecycle.sh`, not through the installer ([install-zone](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/facis-zero-trust-demonstrator/tree/main/scripts/install-zone)) |
| The `zone-policy` release fails at an identity check | The check's job names what is missing: the server or an agent not Ready, no bundle, a trust domain that differs from the zone file, or a labelled pod without an entry | `kubectl -n istio-system logs job/zone-policy-<check>`; the failed job is kept for an hour |

## Admission control rejections

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| An image will not start and the event is generic | Gatekeeper refused it but the reason did not reach the event | Read the provider's decision, which carries the reason code; a refusal with no reason code is a defect in the provider |
| A correctly signed image is refused | The verification key does not match the key the image was signed with | Compare the signing key used by the pipeline with the key material the provider was configured with |
| An unsigned image starts | The constraint is not bound to that namespace, or the provider is not reachable | Confirm the constraint's scope, then confirm the provider answers — an unreachable provider must fail closed, not open |

## Token issuance, DPoP proofs and the token store

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Registration succeeds but no token is issued | The presentation did not verify, so there is nothing to derive a token from | Read the verification outcome first; the token failure is downstream of it |
| A token is rejected on use | The DPoP proof is not bound to the key that requested the token, or is being replayed | Compare the proof's key thumbprint with the one recorded at issuance |
| The upstream call carries the caller's own token | Substitution did not happen | Trace the outbound request — the caller's proof must never be forwarded onward |
| Everything fails after a control-plane blip | The token store failed closed, as designed | Confirm the alert was raised; fail-secure is the correct behaviour, silence is not |

## Attested channel handshake failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| The handshake aborts | The peer's measurement does not match the expected value | Compare the report's measurement with the expected value resolved from TRAIN; a mismatch is a working refusal |
| The handshake aborts and the expected value is absent | The trust-list entry is missing or stale, not the peer | Resolve the peer's digest through TRAIN directly before suspecting the peer |
| The report verifies but the channel is refused | The evidence is not bound to this connection | Confirm the TLS exporter value is present in the report's user data — an unbound report is a replay risk, so refusal is correct |
| Application traffic appears after a failed handshake | A serious defect | This must be impossible and is asserted by an acceptance scenario; treat any instance as a stop-the-line finding |

## Trust-framework DNS

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| The verifier refuses every peer with "no expected value" and nothing was changed | The TCR turns any DNS failure into an empty result, so a broken zone looks like an empty trust list | Run `scripts/verify-train-dns/verify.sh` from the cluster; its sections say which link of the chain failed — see [TRAIN DNS zone](train-dns.md) |
| Every query to the zone manager is REFUSED after a pod restart | NSD came up before the zone's include was written and never reloaded | `nsd-control zonestatus` in the pod lists no zone; `nsd-control reconfig && nsd-control reload` serves it — the deployment runs this at start |
| Validating resolvers answer SERVFAIL for the zone; `dig +cd` answers | The zone is bogus: the DS at the parent no longer matches the key (the volume was rebuilt), or the signatures expired (the `resign` job stopped) | Compare the DS at the parent in full with the DS of the key the zone serves (`dnssec-dsfromkey`, see [TRAIN DNS zone](train-dns.md#dnssec)): a matching key tag is not enough; read the RRSIG expiry on the SOA; the inspector's section 5 does both |
| A pointer was published but a resolver still says NXDOMAIN, with the `ad` flag | The resolver cached the signed denial from before the record existed (NSEC, 3600 s) | Ask the authoritative server directly; wait out the TTL or flush the resolver |

## Credential verification and trust-list staleness

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| A credential that worked yesterday is refused | It was revoked | Check the status list entry before anything else |
| Verification fails for every credential at once | The status list or the trust anchor is unreachable | Check reachability; an unreachable list must deny, and the alert tells you which one it was |
| A peer that should be trusted is not listed | The trust list has not been republished since the peer was added | Compare the published trust list with what the connector resolved, not with what you expect it to contain |

## Deployment lifecycle and the acceptance scenarios

Met while building and running the lifecycle pack (TDR-BDD-01..06) on kind and IONOS.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| A scenario fails before it starts with "the pool namespace is not in its baseline state" | A previous run was interrupted and left a release or objects behind | `kubectl -n <pool namespace> get all,secrets`; uninstall the leftover release through ORCE (an `uninstall` command), not by hand, then rerun |
| `cluster-state.sh` exits 2, "the cluster could not be observed" | The observer kubeconfig is wrong, expired or points at another cluster; API errors are never retried into a pass | `kubectl --kubeconfig <observer> auth whoami`, then `get namespace kube-system` — the UID must be the target's |
| The lifecycle result says `valuesSchemaRejected` for a release you expect to be valid | Its values fail the chart's `values.schema.json`; that is the refusal TDR-BDD-02 relies on | `helm template <chart> -f <values>` locally shows the schema error |
| ORCE starts with the upstream demo flows instead of the lifecycle flow | An old or upstream image: the upstream image sets `FLOWS=flows.json` | The first-party image fixes `flowFile` to `lifecycle.json`; the ORCE log's `Flows file` record must name `/data/lifecycle.json` |
| ORCE refuses to start: "must be set: ORCE does not start without its credentials" | A key of the `orce-credentials` Secret is missing | Compare the Secret's keys with [the ORCE install](environments/ionos.md#3-orce) |
| The ORCE context read returns 401 | The read token is wrong, or it was sent without `Bearer ` | The read token is the `ORCE_READ_TOKEN` of the Secret; it can read, never write |
| No JSON refusal record for a request in the ORCE log (rows 02 and 06) | An image without the JSON log handler, or the log command reads another pod | Every line of `kubectl -n ztd-orce logs deployment/orce` must be one JSON object ([ORCE logging](flows.md#orce-logging)) |
| ORCE is slow to start on an Apple Silicon machine | The image is `linux/amd64` only and runs emulated | Expected locally; allow a few minutes |
| `helm` commands behave differently from the docs | Another Helm major version | The project pins Helm v4.3.0 for chart QA and inside the ORCE image |

## Logs

Records sent through the ORCE logging API are one JSON object per line
([ORCE logging](flows.md#orce-logging)); output outside that API is not. The Go services'
logging convention is set with the observability stack (ZT-27). Correlate by the request identifier
carried across hops rather than by timestamp.
