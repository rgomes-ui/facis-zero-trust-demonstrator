# Architecture

## 6. Plane separation and staleness windows

### Trust boundaries (diagram 03)

Each trust zone is one cluster and its own SPIFFE trust domain (ZT-24, SRS 3.1.2). The two domains
meet only through the attested channel and a TRAIN verdict; they are never merged. The
management-plane components whose placement this section records, the SPIRE server, the
OpenTelemetry Collector and the CMC daemon (cmcd), run in the same cluster as the zone's data-plane
workloads and therefore inside the zone's trust domain: the separation between the planes is a
namespace and policy boundary, not an identity boundary. Data-plane calls into the management plane are denied by default
at both the NetworkPolicy layer and the mesh AuthorizationPolicy layer, and are permitted only along
the paths the allow matrix below lists, which are named mTLS pairs and the declared observability
export under ZT-26 (SRS 3.1.2), with one path the matrix does not yet dispose: the meshed
namespaces' opening to istiod's xDS port, declared under [Declared openings](#declared-openings-of-the-network-baseline). ZT-55
names the first of those two layers the *Kubernetes network policy layer*, a layer and not a
resource kind: in the zones it is enforced by Cilium, through Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` objects
and, where a source is not a pod, `CiliumNetworkPolicy` objects. In this section *NetworkPolicy*
names that layer. The management-plane components whose placement is not yet recorded,
TRAIN (TCR and TSPA), the TSA policy engine and OCM, are drawn outside both zones under the same
rule until their placement is decided; the four provisional rows of the allow matrix are theirs. A
workload without an SVID or running an unsigned image cannot join or start.

![Diagram 03, trust boundaries: zone-a and zone-b are separate SPIFFE trust domains, each holding its data plane and the management-plane components placed in it (SPIRE server, OpenTelemetry Collector, cmcd), with data-plane calls into that management plane denied by default except along the allow-matrix paths and the declared xDS opening; the zones meet only through the attested channel and a TRAIN verdict; TRAIN, the TSA policy engine and OCM are drawn outside both zones under the same rule; anything without an SVID or with an unsigned image is denied](diagrams/03-trust-boundaries.svg)

Source: [`diagrams/03-trust-boundaries.mmd`](diagrams/03-trust-boundaries.mmd). The diagram only
illustrates; every path it draws is listed in the [allow matrix](#allow-matrix-data-plane-management-plane) below.

### Management-plane roles (ZT-55)

ZT-55 (SRS 3.3) names five management-plane components that must be strictly separated from the data
plane network. In this demonstrator they are reachable from the data plane only through the paths
the allow matrix below permits explicitly at both layers; those paths are dedicated control channels
(named mTLS pairs), except the observability export path, which is a declared bypass under ZT-26.
The table binds each of them, in the order the requirement names them, to the service or services
that implement it in this demonstrator. The allow matrix below lists the permitted paths toward
these roles and refers to the roles by name, so coverage of the five components can be checked here
before the permitted paths are read.

The table also binds one role ZT-55 does not name: attestation, implemented by CMC. ZT-55
characterises the management plane with parenthetical examples rather than enumerating it, and its
operative sentence is that compromise of the data plane must not grant any access to
management-plane components. CMC is placed in the management plane by that test: cmcd holds the
zone's attestation keys, enrolled through the estserver, and the pipeline-signed reference metadata
(ZT-71) that the peer zone's trust decision rests on, so a workload able to alter it could alter
what the system trusts. It is bound here because the data plane has a permitted path to it, which
the allow matrix names by role.

Every role in the table below is bound to at least one service; none is unimplemented.

The supply boundary records who provides the software, not who deploys or operates it.
*Project-built* means this project provides the software: it builds or packages it and owns its
configuration. *Client-supplied* means the software is provided to the demonstrator by the client
as part of the XFSC stack; a client-supplied role stays client-supplied when this project deploys
and operates it, as it does for all three below. The column is kept because client-supplied
software is the demonstrator's largest external dependency: its provenance, its versions and its
interfaces are fixed outside this project. It says nothing about enforcement. The layer that
enforces a path to a role follows network topology — where the destination runs relative to its
source — not who supplies the service; see the allow matrix below.

| ZT-55 role | Implementing service(s) | Supply boundary | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policy Engine | TSA policy engine (Trust Services API) | Client-supplied | [External XFSC components](dependencies.md#external-xfsc-components) |
| TRAIN | TCR (trust-list resolution); TSPA (trust-list publication) | Client-supplied | [External XFSC components](dependencies.md#external-xfsc-components); [TSPA in the ZT-35 flow](tspa-publish-api.md#3-what-tspa-is-in-the-zt-35-flow) |
| SPIRE control plane | SPIRE server and its controller-manager | Project-built | [Workload identity](environments/osc.md#3-workload-identity) |
| OCM | OCM W-Stack, used by the backend as the credential verification service | Client-supplied | [External XFSC components](dependencies.md#external-xfsc-components) |
| Observability stack | OpenTelemetry Collector, read through Prometheus and Jaeger | Project-built | [Operations](environments/osc.md#operations) |
| Attestation | cmcd, the per-zone CMC daemon, and its enrolment server (estserver) | Project-built | [Specifications](specifications.md); [trust boundary between the zones](environments/osc.md#7-the-trust-boundary-between-the-zones) |

### Allow matrix (data plane → management plane)

Default DENY at both layers (NetworkPolicy and mesh AuthorizationPolicy). Each ALLOW row below is
permitted explicitly at both the NetworkPolicy layer and the mesh AuthorizationPolicy layer, and
nothing else reaches the management plane, with the one exception declared under
[Declared openings](#declared-openings-of-the-network-baseline): istiod's xDS port, which no row disposes yet. In this demonstrator, a *dedicated control channel* in
the ZT-55 sense is a named, mTLS-authenticated source → destination pair; the rows marked *named
pair* are such channels toward the roles they name. The observability export row is not a named
pair: it is permitted as a declared bypass under ZT-26, defined below the matrix. The ZT-55 role
column names the role from the table above that the destination serves. Any management-plane
destination without its own row is denied by the catch-all row.

ZT-55 (SRS 3.3) requires the separation to be enforced at both the Kubernetes network policy layer
and the service mesh layer, so every row states its disposition at both. The enforcement column
holds layers only: for each row it gives the NetworkPolicy disposition and the mesh
AuthorizationPolicy disposition, and nothing else. A permitted row is permitted explicitly at both
layers; a denied row is denied at both.

On the path of every permitted row the **mesh's L7 proxy** is the single L7 enforcement owner, and
the NetworkPolicy layer is held to L3/L4 for that path. Which proxy that is follows the zone's
`mesh.mode`: the workload's sidecar proxy under sidecar mode, the current baseline
([ADR-0009](adr/0009-service-mesh-mode-istio-sidecar-with-cilium.md)), and the waypoint under
ambient mode. A zone whose `mesh.mode` is `none` has no mesh layer and so no L7 proxy;
it does not meet ZT-55's rule that both layers enforce the separation, and is outside this matrix.
Two L7 decision points on one path would make the fail-closed behaviour ZT-55 depends on
non-deterministic, so each path has exactly one, in either mode. The place of record for the
assignment is the mesh configuration, per path. No per-path mesh AuthorizationPolicy is deployed
yet — the mesh-wide `PeerAuthentication` the `zone-policy` chart renders fixes STRICT mTLS and names
no path's owner — so until one is, this column declares the intended assignment rather than
reflecting a configured one. Once the
configuration is deployed, this matrix reflects that record and does not replace it. If the mesh
configuration changes the owner of a path, this column changes with it.

The test column names the scenario tag that proves each row, in the form the acceptance harness
requires: the requirement row and its acceptance test identifier
([Tags](bdd.md#tags)). A tag is named here even where its scenario is not yet written — the
matrix is the specification that scenario is written from, and the traceability sheet reports the
row as uncovered until it exists.

| From data-plane workload → | ZT-55 role | Allowed? | Enforcement (NetworkPolicy; mesh AuthorizationPolicy) | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PDP adapter → TSA policy engine | Policy Engine | ALLOW (mTLS, named pair) | NetworkPolicy: ALLOW, L3/L4 only; mesh: ALLOW, L7 owner (mesh proxy: sidecar or waypoint, per `mesh.mode`) | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| aTLS gateway → TCR resolve | TRAIN (resolution) | ALLOW (named pair) | NetworkPolicy: ALLOW, L3/L4 only; mesh: ALLOW, L7 owner (mesh proxy: sidecar or waypoint, per `mesh.mode`) | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| aTLS gateway → cmcd | Attestation (CMC) | ALLOW (named pair) | NetworkPolicy: ALLOW, L3/L4 only; mesh: ALLOW, L7 owner (mesh proxy: sidecar or waypoint, per `mesh.mode`) | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| workloads → OTel collector (export only) | Observability stack | ALLOW (declared bypass, ZT-26) | NetworkPolicy: ALLOW, L3/L4 only, egress rule limiting the source to the collector's export port (ZT-26); mesh: ALLOW, L7 owner (mesh proxy: sidecar or waypoint, per `mesh.mode`) | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| backend → verification service | OCM | ALLOW (named pair) | NetworkPolicy: ALLOW, L3/L4 only; mesh: ALLOW, L7 owner (mesh proxy: sidecar or waypoint, per `mesh.mode`) | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| any data-plane workload → TSPA (trust-list publication) | TRAIN (publication) | **DENY** | NetworkPolicy: DENY; mesh: DENY | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| any data-plane workload → SPIRE server | SPIRE control plane | **DENY** | NetworkPolicy: DENY; mesh: DENY | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |
| anything else data → management: any management-plane destination without its own row, including a bound service without a row of its own (estserver) and other management components (for example ArgoCD, OpenBao, Harbor, admin APIs), except istiod's xDS port (a declared opening, no row yet) | any management-plane destination not listed above | **DENY** | NetworkPolicy: DENY; mesh: DENY | `@ZT-55 @BDD-ZT-055` |

**Same-cluster assumption.** The layers named above assume that the destination runs in the same
cluster as the source workload, where both are policies between namespaces. The enforcing
mechanism follows network topology rather than who supplies a service: a destination in another
cluster is reached through an egress rule, and one outside the estate through a different control
again. Placement is recorded for the SPIRE control plane, the observability stack and attestation
only, so four rows are provisional: PDP adapter → TSA policy engine, aTLS gateway → TCR resolve, backend →
verification service, and the denied row any data-plane workload → TSPA. The denied row is
included because a denial across a cluster boundary rests on a different mechanism than one within
a cluster. Once their destinations are placed, these rows will also name their egress rule.

**Declared bypass.** A *declared bypass* is a path exempted from the Zero Trust Connector under
ZT-26 (SRS 3.1.2). ZT-26 exempts protocols and endpoints not related to inter-connector
communication, naming DNS and administrative or observability APIs as examples; the classes this
section declares from those examples are name resolution, observability export and cluster
administration. A declared bypass is listed with its reason and remains subject to its own ingress
and egress controls. It bypasses the Connector only — not the mesh and not the network layer — and
the term carries no other meaning in this section. The observability row above and the
name-resolution row under [Supporting services](#supporting-services-outside-the-management-plane)
are the two rows of this section that carry it; the entries of the cluster-administration class
are listed under [Declared openings](#declared-openings-of-the-network-baseline), and none of them is a row here.

This matrix is not the ZT-26 bypass list, which is a separate reviewed artefact; the rows here that
carry a declared bypass are entries in that list, not the list itself. Cluster administration is
a declared class with no row here. Three of its entries have sources that are not data-plane
workloads — the API server, the host-networked SPIRE agents, the management-plane namespaces — and
the domain of this matrix is paths from the data plane to the management plane. The fourth, the
opening from every pod of the meshed plane namespaces to istiod's xDS port, does originate in
data-plane pods: it is the one path into the management plane this matrix does not yet dispose,
and it is declared as such under [Declared openings](#declared-openings-of-the-network-baseline) and in
[Specifications](specifications.md). Any other administrative endpoint a data-plane workload
reaches remains denied by the catch-all row.

**Out of scope: collection initiated from the management plane.** Paths initiated from the
management plane toward a data-plane cluster, such as metric collection pulled by the
observability interfaces, are outside this matrix. ZT-55 governs reachability from the data plane,
so the matrix models that direction only.

Each row of the matrix is justified below. A permitted row states the requirement that needs the
path, which end initiates it, and the surface it is limited to. A denied row states what reaching
the destination would give a compromised data-plane workload; the catch-all row states the role it
plays in the matrix.

- **PDP adapter → TSA policy engine — Policy Engine.** ZT-20 (SRS 3.1.1) requires the connector's
  guard to base its enforcement on Rego policies and the TSA policy engine, and ZT-52 (SRS 3.3)
  allows no access to a protected resource without a valid, verified policy decision. The engine
  runs as its own service, so the enforcement point obtains every decision over the network, and
  the PDP adapter is its route to the engine: without this path the enforcement point cannot obtain
  a decision, and every guarded request is denied. The PDP adapter initiates each call; the engine
  answers and never calls into the data plane over this path. The surface is policy evaluation
  only — a decision request out and its verdict back — not the administration of the policies the
  engine evaluates.
- **aTLS gateway → TCR resolve — TRAIN (resolution).** ZT-35 (SRS 3.1.3) requires any endpoint
  that establishes attested TLS connections to *resolve* its peers' trusted hashes from TRAIN, so
  the aTLS gateway needs a read path to TCR at run time. Resolution is needed when a channel is
  established: the gateway fetches the peer's hash from TRAIN and proceeds only if it matches the
  value in the peer's attestation report, so without this path no attested channel between the
  zones can be established. The gateway initiates; TCR answers and never calls into the data plane
  over this path. The surface is resolution — a peer's hash is looked up, never written.
  Publication, the write side of TRAIN, is a separate row and is denied.
- **aTLS gateway → cmcd — Attestation (CMC).** The attested channel between the zones requires both
  ends to present evidence of the software they run, bound to the TLS connection it is presented on
  ([trust boundary between the zones](environments/osc.md#7-the-trust-boundary-between-the-zones)).
  That evidence comes from CMC (ZT-31; [specifications](specifications.md)): the SRS grounds the
  bidirectional remote attestation feature (SRS 5.2) in the CMC aTLS protocol (SRS 2.6.1), and its
  appendix on attested TLS refers to the REQUIRED CMC daemon (SRS 6). The gateway reaches cmcd to
  have its own evidence produced and its peer's evidence verified, so without this path it cannot
  establish attested TLS as ZT-35 (SRS 3.1.3) requires. The gateway initiates; cmcd answers and
  never calls into the data plane over this path. The surface is attestation only — evidence
  produced for the gateway and a peer's evidence verified — not the provisioning of cmcd's keys or
  of the pipeline-signed reference metadata (ZT-71) it checks evidence against. That provisioning
  runs from the estserver to cmcd inside the management plane, and the estserver stays denied to
  the data plane by the catch-all row.
- **workloads → OTel collector — Observability stack.** ZT-27 (SRS 3.1.2) requires events to be
  exported from the cluster in a standard format and names the OpenTelemetry Collector as the
  primary aggregation and export tool, so data-plane workloads must be able to reach the collector.
  ZT-26 (SRS 3.1.2) places observability APIs among the endpoints that must bypass the Zero Trust
  Connector, and requires them to use their own appropriate ingress and egress configuration
  instead; that is the declared bypass this row carries. ZT-52 (SRS 3.3) requires control-plane
  failures to be detected within 30 seconds and alerted through the observability stack, and a
  failure the data plane observes, such as a policy engine that no longer answers, reaches that
  alerting only over this path. The row is therefore not a dedicated control channel, as the
  definition above the matrix says, and it is not an exception granted against ZT-55 (SRS 3.3)
  either: it is a path these requirements compel, and denying it would break ZT-27 and ZT-52
  without adding to the separation ZT-55 requires.

  What these requirements need is narrower than reaching the observability stack, and the row
  permits only that. The source is admitted by the workload identity it holds, its SVID. The
  destination is the collector alone, not Prometheus, Jaeger or any other part of the stack. The
  surface is the collector's export port, to which the egress rule in the enforcement column limits
  the source. The workload initiates, and telemetry travels outward only: the path lets a workload
  hand its telemetry to the collector and opens no route back into the stack, to the data it holds
  or to its configuration. None of this depends on which component takes the L7 decision on the
  path, so a change of mesh mode leaves the justification standing.
- **backend → verification service — OCM.** ZT-40 (SRS 3.1.5) bases access on credentials from
  the OCM W-Stack, and ZT-51 (SRS 3.3) requires revocation status to be checked at every credential
  verification, failing closed when it cannot be. A verdict held from an earlier verification
  cannot stand in for a new one: it records the credential's status when that verification ran,
  so a credential revoked since would still pass. Each new verification therefore reaches the
  service, and the [staleness matrix](#staleness-matrix) bounds how long one verification's outcome
  is relied on. The backend initiates; the verification service answers and never calls into the
  data plane over this path. The surface is credential verification — a presentation out and its
  verification result, revocation status included, back — not the issuance or revocation of
  credentials.
- **any data-plane workload → TSPA — TRAIN (publication).** The two TRAIN rows carry opposite
  verdicts on purpose. The resolution row above rests on ZT-35 (SRS 3.1.3). The same requirement
  assigns *publication* to the endpoint's CI/CD pipeline, which uploads the hash on deployment; no
  data-plane workload publishes. Publication writes the trust anchors that every peer relies on, so
  leaving it reachable from the data plane would let a compromised data-plane workload alter trust
  decisions, which ZT-55 forbids. Publication therefore stays denied from the data plane and is
  reached only through the pipeline's publication path.
- **any data-plane workload → SPIRE server — SPIRE control plane.** Under ZT-24 (SRS 3.1.2) the
  SPIRE server issues the SVIDs by which every other row names its source and destination, and
  holds the registration entries that decide which workload receives which identity. A compromised
  data-plane workload that reached it could seek identities it was never issued, or alter the
  registrations that assign them; every named pair in this matrix, and the identity that admits the
  observability row, would then rest on identities the attacker controls. That is the access to the
  management plane that ZT-55 (SRS 3.3) requires a compromise of the data plane never to grant. The
  denial does not cut a workload off from its own identity. A workload receives its SVID by the
  node-local path, from the SPIRE agent on its node through a mounted volume
  ([workload identity](environments/osc.md#3-workload-identity)), and the agent, which is part of
  the SPIRE deployment rather than a data-plane workload, is what talks to the server. The path
  this row denies is the one from a workload to the server itself.
- **anything else data → management — any management-plane destination not listed above.** The
  rows above do not name every management-plane destination: the estserver, bound to the
  attestation role, has no row of its own, and other management components such as ArgoCD, OpenBao,
  Harbor and administrative APIs are bound to no role at all. This row is what
  makes the matrix a closed statement about the management plane rather than a list of examples:
  every management-plane destination is either named by a row above or denied by this one, and
  none is denied merely by being left out. This row is also what the plane-separation test asserts
  for any management-plane destination it probes and does not find listed: that destination is
  unreachable at both layers. The closure has one declared gap, which that test leaves out:
  istiod's xDS port, reached under the opening described under
  [Declared openings](#declared-openings-of-the-network-baseline), which no row disposes yet.

### Supporting services (outside the management plane)

The allow matrix covers destinations in the management plane, so a permitted destination outside
it is recorded here; without a row, a reader would apply the catch-all denial to it. A destination
is outside the management plane when reaching it grants no ability to alter what the system runs,
trusts or holds, which is the test ZT-55 (SRS 3.3) states. Absence from the components ZT-55 lists
decides nothing either way: the same test places attestation in the management plane
([management-plane roles](#management-plane-roles-zt-55)) and drives the catch-all denial. Each
row is justified by its own requirement, is not an exception to ZT-55, and sits under the same
default DENY at both layers. A row need not be a named mTLS pair: a service whose traffic the mesh
cannot govern is permitted at the network layer and says so. These rows are proved by the
acceptance families of their own requirements ([scenario inventory](bdd.md#scenario-inventory)),
not by the plane-separation test, so the table has no test column.

| From data-plane workload → | Supporting service | Allowed? | Enforcement (NetworkPolicy; mesh AuthorizationPolicy) |
|---|---|---|---|
| workloads → DNS | name-resolution infrastructure | ALLOW (declared bypass, ZT-26) | NetworkPolicy: ALLOW, the resolver's port only (53; 8053 on the Gardener clusters); mesh: not applicable — DNS is not mTLS traffic, so the mesh cannot govern it |

- **workloads → DNS — name-resolution infrastructure.** Data-plane workloads reach every
  destination permitted above by service name, so none of those paths works without name
  resolution. DNS is cluster infrastructure and a declared bypass under ZT-26, in the sense defined
  above. The mesh cannot govern it because it is not mTLS traffic, so the NetworkPolicy rule
  limited to the resolver's port (53; 8053 on the Gardener clusters) imposes the restriction.

### Declared openings of the network baseline

Beside the DNS bypass, the network baseline of a meshed zone has four declared openings for the two
control planes: the identity control plane (`spire-system`) and the mesh control plane
(`istio-system`), both management-plane namespaces under the default deny. They are entries of the
**cluster-administration** class of the Zero Trust Connector bypass list (ZT-26: administrative
APIs), each listed with its reason, and none is a row of the allow matrix. Three have sources that
are not data-plane workloads. The fourth, `meshControlPlane`, does not: its egress rule selects
every pod of every plane namespace that carries the mesh label, the management-plane namespace
`ztd-mgmt` among them by default, so every process of every such pod reaches istiod's xDS port,
15012, and no other port of istiod. That is a path from
the data plane into the management plane which the allow matrix does not yet dispose, and this
section does not claim otherwise. The mesh's proxies cannot be configured without it
([Workload identity](workload-identity.md#the-proxy)); no AuthorizationPolicy can govern it,
because such a policy is enforced by the proxy of its destination and istiod runs without one; and
whether istiod serves only clients it has authenticated is Istio's default behaviour, neither pinned in the zone's values nor proven by
the evidence. It is declared in [Specifications](specifications.md) as a proposed reading of ZT-55,
with its approval pending; the row that disposes it, with istiod's client authentication pinned
and proven, is left to a follow-up. istiod's CA answers on the same port and cannot be switched
off; a certificate it issues is refused by every meshed peer, whose `ROOTCA` is SPIRE's bundle
alone, as every run of the mesh identity proof shows (see `scripts/verify-mesh-identity/README.md`). The other three openings keep
the catch-all denial whole: in particular a data-plane workload reaches the SPIRE server on no
port. Each opening is rendered by the umbrella chart only when the zone file enables it, and is
proven by the named check of the mesh identity proof, which every run records (see
`scripts/verify-mesh-identity/README.md`):

| Opening | Source | Destination | Port | Network policy layer | Proving check |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `meshControlPlane` | every pod of every plane namespace with the mesh label (`ztd-mgmt` among them by default) | istiod (`istio-system`) | 15012 (xDS) | egress in the source namespaces, ingress in `istio-system` (Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`) | `control-planes-under-default-deny` (proxies SYNCED; no other istiod port reachable) |
| `controlPlaneWebhooks` | the API server (entities `kube-apiserver`, `host`, `remote-node`); where the zone names it, the provider's pod that relays the API server's calls (`fromEndpoints`; Gardener's `vpn-shoot` on zone A and zone B) | istiod's webhook; the SPIRE controller-manager's webhook | 15017; 9443 | ingress in `istio-system` and `spire-system` (`CiliumNetworkPolicy`) | `control-planes-under-default-deny`, `install-order-idempotent` (injection and admission work) |
| `identityServer` | the SPIRE agents on the host network (entities `host`, `remote-node`) | the SPIRE server | 8081 | ingress in `spire-system` (`CiliumNetworkPolicy`) | `control-planes-under-default-deny` (every agent attested) |
| `kubeApi` | pods of the management-plane namespaces | the API server (entity `kube-apiserver`) | the API server's port | egress in each management-plane namespace (`CiliumNetworkPolicy`) | `install-order-idempotent` (the controllers reconcile) |

The sources of the last three are not pods, so they are expressed as Cilium entities rather than
addresses ([Workload identity](workload-identity.md#openings-under-the-default-deny)). The sidecar
reaches its SPIRE agent over a mounted socket and the agent reaches the kubelet over the host's
loopback, so neither needs an opening.

### Staleness matrix

Maximum window in which a revoked or rotated artefact still authorises. The allow matrix governs
which management-plane decisions may travel to the data plane; the staleness matrix bounds how long
they take to arrive. The staleness matrix is deliberately broader than the allow matrix: a row is
in scope because its freshness bounds an authorisation, not because its producer is one of the five
components ZT-55 (SRS 3.3) names, so rows for artefacts outside those five are not to be removed
as inconsistencies. These values are what §6 commits to, and configuration has to meet them.

The test column names the scenario tag that proves each row's window, in the form the acceptance
harness requires: the requirement row and its acceptance test identifier ([Tags](bdd.md#tags)). A
tag is named here even where its scenario is not yet written — the matrix is the specification that
scenario is written from, and the traceability sheet reports the row as uncovered until it exists.

| Artefact | Rotation/lifetime | Cache or held outcome | Max stale-authorisation window | Enforced by | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SVID | 1 h TTL | in-process | ≤ 1 h | mesh | `@ZT-24 @BDD-ZT-024` |
| Connector issuer JWKS | rotate on demand | guard cache 5 min | ≤ 5 min | connector guard | `@ZT-22 @BDD-ZT-022` |
| Access token | 300 s lifetime | — | ≤ 300 s after revocation of its basis | guard and token store | `@ZT-22 @BDD-ZT-022` |
| Policy bundle | poll 60 s | TSA cache | ≤ 60 s | TSA policy engine | `@ZT-20 @BDD-ZT-020` |
| Trust list / measurement | TTL 300 s | TCR/gateway | ≤ 300 s + channel lifetime 15 min ⇒ ≤ ~20 min for an established channel (bounded by channel re-establishment) | aTLS gateway | `@ZT-35 @BDD-ZT-035` |
| Credential revocation | checked per verification | outcome relied on 120 s | ≤ token lifetime + outcome reliance period; in force ≤ 300 s + 120 s | backend and token store | `@ZT-51 @BDD-ZT-051` |

- **Trust list / measurement.** The window bounds the locally held copy from the moment the
  published list changes, not the time until it changes upstream: the trust list is not
  provisioned by this project.
- **Connector issuer JWKS.** The connector guard validates token signatures against the
  connector's own published key set, so that is the artefact this row bounds. No requirement
  governs that key set's freshness directly: the SRS names neither a key set nor its rotation. The
  row carries the tag of the requirement whose behaviour depends on it. ZT-22 (SRS 3.1.1) requires
  the access token a participant backend presents to be checked and, if valid, upstreamed; that
  check is made against this key set, so a key set stale past a rotation makes it fail. The key
  set itself is produced by the OAuth2 server that ZT-21 (SRS 3.1.1) mandates.
