# Environments

The demonstrator runs across **three managed Kubernetes clusters**: two on T-Systems Open Sovereign
Cloud carrying the two demonstration zones, and one on IONOS Cloud carrying the CI/CD and
visualization environment. The reasoning for three rather than two is recorded in
[ADR-0005](../adr/0005-three-cluster-reading-of-the-target-environment.md).

| Environment | Clusters | Role | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-Systems Open Sovereign Cloud | 2 | Zone A and zone B — the two demonstration zones and their trust boundary | [OSC setup](osc.md) — provided (contexts `zerotrust-a`, `zerotrust-b`); both zones installed and kept on interim trust domains, the mesh proven node-locally (it fails across nodes on the provider's pod masquerading until the provider changes it); the proof: [the guide's proving step](osc.md#proving-steps-2-to-4-the-mesh-identity-proof) and `scripts/verify-mesh-identity/README.md` |
| IONOS Cloud | 1 | CI/CD and the visualization environment | [IONOS setup](ionos.md) — provided; ORCE and the BDD pool installed |

Application services that run before the zones exist, and how they are installed without cluster
rights, are described in [Application workloads](application-workloads.md).

Each guide is written to be followed start to finish by someone who has not seen the cluster before.
Where a step cannot be executed yet it says so, rather than reading as though it had been done.

## What is common to all three

- **Kubernetes 1.29 or later.** Older versions are not supported; the mesh and admission baselines
  assume it. A cluster that runs the mesh needs **1.33 or later**, for the native sidecar containers
  of [ADR-0009](../adr/0009-service-mesh-mode-istio-sidecar-with-cilium.md).
- **Cilium as CNI** on the clusters that run the mesh, configured with `cni.exclusive=false` so the
  Istio CNI plugin can chain behind it, and **Istio in sidecar mode** on top
  ([ADR-0009](../adr/0009-service-mesh-mode-istio-sidecar-with-cilium.md); ambient is the parked
  alternative). The IONOS cluster runs no mesh today and keeps its provider-managed Calico; see its
  guide.
- **The clusters are client-provided.** Provisioning them is out of scope; these guides begin at the
  point where a kubeconfig is in hand.
- **Nothing is applied by hand.** Every step below is a chart, a script in `scripts/` or a pipeline
  run. A step that cannot be expressed that way is a defect in the step, not a reason to click.

## Installing a zone

A zone is installed by one command from one zone file: `scripts/install-zone/install.sh install`,
which runs seven Helm releases in order — the umbrella `ztd`, `spire-crds`, `spire`, `istio-base`,
`istiod`, `istio-cni`, `zone-policy` — each through the deployment lifecycle step, and exits 0 only
when every pod of the zone is Ready. The zone file records the cluster's facts (Kubernetes version,
storage class, load balancer) and, where the mesh runs, the zone's trust domain (a name under the DNS
zone delegated to the trust framework, one per zone) and the API server's port. The [OSC guide](osc.md#2-the-zone-layout)
walks through it step by step with each step's verification; the identity path is described in
[Workload identity](../workload-identity.md).

## Reproduction and verification

ZT-16 asks for documentation from which the setup of each cluster can be reproduced step by step.
Each guide therefore pairs every stage with the check that proves the stage worked — the command,
and what its output has to say. A stage without a check is not finished.
