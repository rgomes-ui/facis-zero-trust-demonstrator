# BDD acceptance specifications

Every acceptance requirement is expressed as an executable scenario, tagged with the requirement it
covers, so that traceability from requirement to test is generated rather than maintained by hand.

## Conventions

- Every Annex A row has exactly one scenario, and its Given, When and Then are the Annex wording
  byte for byte (see [The pack](#the-pack)). The [BDD catalogue](bdd-catalogue.md) lists them all.
- Each scenario carries a tag naming its requirement.
- Scenarios run both in CI and against live clusters.
- Negative cases assert against the audit entry that recorded the refusal, not merely against a
  failed response.

## The harness

Two runners, one report. Go scenarios run under [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog) and
JavaScript scenarios under [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js); both emit the
same legacy cucumber-JSON, so their results merge by concatenation and produce a single
traceability sheet.

| | Runner | Scenarios | Steps | Report |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Go | godog | `features/go/` | `internal/bdd/` | `bundles/bdd/go-report.json` |
| JavaScript | Cucumber.js | `features/js/` | `features/js/steps/` | `bundles/bdd/js-report.json` |

**Each runner owns its own directory, and a scenario belongs to exactly one.** A runner that
loads the other's scenarios cannot execute their steps; it would report them as undefined and —
unless the run is strict — still pass, marking those Annex rows covered by scenarios that never
ran.

Each runner runs three ways, and one sheet merges them:

| Run | Scenarios | Strict | Go | JavaScript |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **strict** | implemented, not `@cluster` | yes: an undefined or pending step fails | `go test ./internal/bdd` | `npm run bdd` |
| **catalogue** | `@pending` | no: pending steps are expected | `BDD_MODE=catalogue go test ./internal/bdd` | `npm run bdd:catalogue` |
| **cluster** | `@cluster` | yes | — | `npm run bdd:cluster` (needs a cluster, see below) |

In a pull request the cluster scenarios cannot run, so `npm run bdd:cluster-dryrun` lists them
instead. `BDD_MODE` is read inside the Go test binary: unset means strict (the shared `go test ./...`
job sets nothing), and any other value than `strict` or `catalogue` fails.

```bash
go run ./cmd/bddpack -check                                            # the pack matches the Annex
GODOG_CUCUMBER_OUT=bundles/bdd/go-report.json go test ./internal/bdd   # Go, strict
BDD_MODE=catalogue GODOG_CUCUMBER_OUT=bundles/bdd/go-catalogue-report.json go test ./internal/bdd
npm ci && npm run bdd && npm run bdd:catalogue && npm run bdd:cluster-dryrun
go run ./cmd/bddreport --require-complete --rows features/annex-rows.txt --out bundles/bdd \
  bundles/bdd/go-report.json bundles/bdd/js-report.json bundles/bdd/go-catalogue-report.json \
  bundles/bdd/js-catalogue-report.json bundles/bdd/js-cluster-dryrun.json
```

### The pack

`features/annex/annex-a.json` is the one source: the 94 rows of Annex A v1.7, exported once from
the client's workbook (its SHA-256 is recorded), each with its statement split into Given, When and
Then, its family, runner, status (`implemented` or `pending`) and whether it runs on a cluster.
`go run ./cmd/bddpack` renders from it every feature file except the hand-written
`features/js/lifecycle.feature`, the pending step definitions of both runners
(`internal/bdd/pending_gen_test.go`, `features/js/steps/pending.gen.mjs`), `features/annex-rows.txt`
and the [catalogue](bdd-catalogue.md). `-check` fails when a generated file is stale or when any
feature file, hand-written or generated, departs from the Annex: a row with no scenario or two, a
step that differs by one character, or a row, test-id or `@pending` tag above the scenario.

A **pending** row has its Annex scenario and the tag `@pending`; its steps are registered as
pending (exact-text patterns, never Cucumber expressions, because many clauses contain `/` or
`( )`), so the row is reported as *not run*. Implementing a row means setting its status to
`implemented`, writing real steps and regenerating. A clause shared by two rows stays pending until
both are implemented, and the generator refuses the source otherwise. The Annex marks ZT-42/ZT-79
and ZT-46/ZT-81 as one shared execution each; each pair is one scenario carrying both rows' tags.

Checks that exist but prove only part of a row — the usage manual in the site navigation (behind
ZT-17), pinned and scoped workflows (behind ZT-56) — stay as untagged `@regression` scenarios. They
run strict and do not cover a row.

Cucumber.js describes its `json` formatter as being in maintenance mode; it is the interchange
format both runners share today, and the documented upgrade path when that changes is the
`message` format. Nothing else in the harness depends on the choice.

### Tags

A scenario carries two tags: the **requirement row** it covers and the **test identifier** from
Annex A, plus `@pending` while the row is not implemented and `@cluster` when it needs a cluster.

```gherkin
@TDR-BDD-01 @BDD-TDR-001
Scenario: Successful deployment [fixture release]
```

Only the row tag drives coverage. A tag shaped like a row id that matches no row in
`features/annex-rows.txt` **fails the run** — a typo would otherwise leave the scenario passing
while proving nothing about the row it was meant to cover.

The plane-separation design check — *The plane-separation matrix is complete and consistent at
both layers*, in `features/go/plane-separation-design.feature` — is one of those regression
scenarios. It runs strict in CI and asserts that the matrices in the
[plane-separation section](architecture.md#6-plane-separation-and-staleness-windows) are complete
and consistent: every path from the data plane to the management plane is disposed at both the
network policy layer and the service mesh layer, in agreement with its verdict, and the catch-all
row denies every management-plane destination without a row of its own. It reaches no network, so
it carries no row tag and ZT-55 stays pending. The row is covered by the reachability scenario,
not yet written, which runs when the matrix is executed against a cluster and asserts that a
management-plane destination without a row is unreachable from the data plane at both layers. It
is the scenario the section refers to when it says what the plane-separation test asserts for a
destination it probes and does not find listed.

### Running one Annex row

```bash
BDD_MODE=catalogue go test ./internal/bdd -godog.tags=@ZT-56   # a pending Go row
npm run bdd:row -- @ZT-17                                      # a JavaScript row, strict:
                                                               # fails while ZT-17 is pending
```

`-godog.tags` narrows the mode's own filter; it cannot widen a strict run to pending rows.

### The traceability sheet

`features/annex-rows.txt` holds the 94 Annex A row ids in Annex order and is the denominator: the
sheet reports every row, covered or not, so a gap is visible rather than absent. `cmd/bddreport`
generates `traceability.md` and `traceability.csv` from the tags in the merged report — the sheet
is never edited by hand.

Covered is not proven. Each row also carries a **result** taken from the step and hook results of
every execution that covers it: `passed` only when every execution passed, on every target and for
every Outline example; `failed` when any one failed; `not run` when any was skipped or had no steps.
A pending step counts as `not run` only in a scenario tagged `@pending`; anywhere else it fails the
row, so a stray pending step in an implemented scenario cannot hide.

With `--require-complete` the sheet is written first, then the run fails if any row is uncovered or
failed; a missing report therefore cannot pass. `not run` rows are complete: they are covered, and
their result says they prove nothing yet.

The pipeline runs all of this on every pull request, writes the sheet into the job summary, and
publishes `bundles/bdd` as the `bdd-evidence` artefact, which is the per-gate evidence bundle.

## Scenario inventory

The scenarios are grouped by the part of the architecture they exercise. Each family carries the
requirements it proves and the negative case it must include — a family with no negative case is
incomplete, because the demonstrator's claim is about what it refuses.

| Family | Requirements | Positive case | Negative case it must include |
|---|---|---|---|
| Workload identity | ZT-24, ZT-57, ZT-59, ZT-60 | A workload attests and receives an SVID whose SPIFFE ID matches its service account | Failed attestation yields no identity **and** no mesh connectivity |
| Mesh enrolment and segmentation | ZT-01, ZT-23, ZT-25, ZT-26, ZT-27, ZT-58, ZT-61, ZT-62 | All service traffic is routed through the mesh; only configured identities may talk | An unaffiliated workload is refused, and the refusal is not IP-based |
| Management/data plane separation | ZT-49, ZT-53, ZT-55 | The management plane is unreachable from the data plane | A data-plane workload attempting a management-plane call is denied at the network layer |
| Admission control | ZT-02, ZT-11, ZT-12, ZT-36, ZT-37, ZT-72 | A correctly signed image is admitted | An unsigned or wrongly signed image is refused, with the reason code in the admission log |
| Supply chain | ZT-10, ZT-13, ZT-38, ZT-54, ZT-56, ZT-71 | Images build on the runner, are signed by digest, and ship an SBOM and a mock attestation | A non-Linux image, or one missing its signature, fails the pipeline |
| Attested channel | ZT-04, ZT-19, ZT-28…ZT-34, ZT-63, ZT-65…ZT-70 | Both ends attest, the verdict is machine-readable, and application traffic follows | A tampered measurement aborts the handshake — and it is **proven** no application traffic passed (ZT-70) |
| Expected measurements and trust lists | ZT-03, ZT-18, ZT-35, ZT-64 | Peer digests resolve through TRAIN and match | A stale or absent trust-list entry refuses the peer |
| Authorization surface | ZT-07, ZT-20, ZT-21, ZT-22, ZT-39, ZT-48, ZT-73, ZT-74, ZT-76, ZT-77, TDR-BDD-05 | Dynamic registration, a token derived from a verified presentation, DPoP-bound and substituted upstream | A replayed or unbound DPoP proof is rejected; a wrong scope is denied with an OID4VP link |
| Credential lifecycle | ZT-40, ZT-51 | A credential is issued to the wallet and unlocks the protected resource | A revoked credential flips verification negative and the token store fails closed |
| Policy decision | ZT-06, ZT-41, ZT-75 | The guard permits on a matching policy and returns the resource | No matching policy denies, with the rule and reason recorded |
| Fail-secure behaviour | ZT-47, ZT-52 | Each request is authorised on its own merits | Control-plane unavailability denies rather than admits, and raises an alert |
| Security baseline | ZT-50, TDR-BDD-07, TDR-BDD-08 | TLS 1.3 and BSI TR-02102 algorithms only; credentials held in Kubernetes Secrets | An older TLS version or a deprecated algorithm is rejected; no plaintext secret appears in a log |
| Target environments | ZT-14, ZT-15, TDR-BDD-10 | The stack runs on each target and its Keycloak and trust endpoints respond | An unsigned image is blocked on the target |
| Release quality | TDR-BDD-09, TDR-BDD-11 | The release's required objects exist and are ready; helm lint and dry-run pass | A chart that fails lint or dry-run cannot be promoted |
| Visualization and journey | ZT-05, ZT-08, ZT-09, ZT-43, ZT-44, ZT-45, ZT-46/ZT-81, ZT-78, ZT-80 | The ORCE journey runs end to end and each step is visible | Every refusal above is visible in the UI, not only in a log |
| Documentation and reproduction | ZT-16, ZT-17, ZT-42/ZT-79 | Each cluster is reproduced from the [environment guides](environments/index.md) alone | A step that cannot be reproduced from the documentation fails the check |
| Deployment lifecycle | TDR-BDD-01…TDR-BDD-04 | A release deploys, redeploys idempotently and uninstalls through ORCE | Invalid parameters are refused with a machine-readable error and leave nothing behind |
| ORCE automation QA | TDR-BDD-06 | — | A controlled error logs a JSON record and exposes its machine-readable error in the ORCE context |
| Final acceptance | M7-01, M7-02 | The approved journey is demonstrated and the final report accepted | No open Critical/High release blocker at the final validation |

A pair written `ZT-46/ZT-81` is one shared execution (one scenario, both rows).

## The deployment-lifecycle pack

`features/js/lifecycle.feature` covers TDR-BDD-01..04: deploy, invalid parameters (three
examples), idempotent redeploy and uninstall. `features/js/orce-qa.feature` covers TDR-BDD-06: a
controlled error (values the chart's schema rejects) whose log record must be whole-line JSON
([ORCE logging](flows.md#orce-logging)), carry the refusal, and contain neither the ORCE HTTP
credentials nor the read token, while its machine-readable error is read from the ORCE context. Each scenario sends a command to the ORCE lifecycle
workflow ([IF-08](api-docs.md)), reads the final result back from the ORCE context, and decides the
outcome from the cluster with `scripts/bdd/cluster-state.sh` under a read-only identity.

The scenarios are tagged `@cluster`: they need a cluster with ORCE and never run in a pull
request. There a dry run lists them, so the traceability sheet shows their rows as covered but
not run rather than as gaps.

### How the cluster decides

Each row has its own namespace from the BDD pool (`ztd-bdd-tdr-001`..`004` and `006`), provisioned with ORCE
by the `deployment/helm/bdd-pool` chart. Before a scenario the namespace must hold only its
documented baseline; afterwards it is restored through the same workflow. Every object in it is
classified:

| Class | What | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline | the pool's own ServiceAccount, root-CA ConfigMap, Roles and RoleBindings | same set, same UIDs, throughout |
| Helm metadata | the release's `helm.sh/release.v1` Secrets | one per history revision, exactly one deployed |
| Expected | every top-level object the release rendered | all present, ready, same UIDs across a redeploy |
| Descendants | ReplicaSets and Pods of an expected Deployment; EndpointSlices and the legacy Endpoints of an expected Service | allow-list only; one active ReplicaSet, the desired Pods, endpoints that match the ready Pods and the resolved ports |
| Events | Event objects | ignored |
| Unexplained | anything else | must be empty — an orphan or duplicate fails the row |

Readiness means the rollout is complete, not that some pods are up. Every check is polled until it
holds or a deadline passes (120 s by default), so asynchronous controllers are waited for; an API
or authorization error fails at once and is never retried into a pass. ORCE and the observer must
report the same `kube-system` UID, so a result can never come from another cluster.

### Running it

Client targets run it **only through CI** (`bdd-cluster` job, one run at a time per target; see
[CI/CD](ci-cd.md)). Against a developer's local cluster — never evidence:

```bash
scripts/dev/kind-up.sh      # kind (Kubernetes 1.35) + BDD pool + identity kubeconfigs in .dev/kind/
scripts/dev/orce-up.sh      # the ORCE image on kind's network, deploying as the pool's deployer;
                            # writes the runner inputs below to .dev/kind/orce.env
set -a && . .dev/kind/orce.env && set +a
npm run bdd:cluster         # about 40 s; evidence in bundles/bdd/evidence/
scripts/dev/orce-down.sh && scripts/dev/kind-down.sh
```

The ORCE image is amd64 only; on an arm64 machine Docker runs it emulated.

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `KUBECONFIG` | the read-only observer identity |
| `BDD_ORCE_URL` | ORCE base URL |
| `BDD_ORCE_ADMIN_TOKEN` | read-only ORCE admin API bearer token |
| `BDD_ORCE_HTTP_USER`, `BDD_ORCE_HTTP_PASS` | credentials of the ORCE HTTP endpoints |
| `BDD_ORCE_LOGS_CMD` | a command printing the ORCE log (rows 02 and 06 assert the JSON refusal record) |
| `BDD_RELEASE_CHART` | the release under test, a chart path in the ORCE image; default the lifecycle fixture |
| `BDD_RELEASE_VALUES` | its valid baseline values; default the fixture's `ci/values.yaml` |
| `BDD_TARGET`, `BDD_RUN_ID` | names the target and the run in the evidence |

A missing input stops the run and is named.

### The release under test

The pack deploys `features/fixtures/charts/lifecycle-fixture`, a namespaced chart with no CRDs,
and every evidence directory records that it is fixture evidence. A fixture pass is **not**
acceptance of the umbrella release. The umbrella chart (`deployment/helm/ztd`) is cluster-scoped: it
creates the plane namespaces and a cluster role, which the pool-confined deployer cannot do. Before
it may replace the fixture, those cluster-scoped deploy rights must be designed
([Umbrella chart](umbrella-chart.md#release-namespace-and-teardown)); it then needs its own run.
The ownership and removal of CRDs is answered by the shape of the zone: one Helm release per upstream
chart, so every CRD is installed, upgraded and removed by the release that ships it in its
templates (`spire-crds`, Istio's `base`), and the umbrella itself ships none. `spire-crds` drops
the chart's `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` in its values, so `helm uninstall` removes its CRDs;
Istio's `base` sets that policy in its files, so the zone installer deletes that release's CRDs
after uninstalling it. The zone installer,
`scripts/install-zone/install.sh`, runs the releases in order through the same lifecycle step this
pack exercises, and its uninstall leaves no SPIRE or Istio CRD behind, as the teardown section of
every run of the mesh identity proof shows (see `scripts/verify-mesh-identity/README.md`).

### Evidence

Per row, target and example: `bundles/bdd/evidence/bdd-tdr-00n/<target>/<example>/` holds the
commands and acknowledgements, the ORCE context entry of each command (with the masked Helm output,
release revision, chart digest and values hash), every classified inventory, the recorded baseline,
for row 02 the refusal log record, and for row 06 the log record and a sample of the ORCE log.

## Traceability

Each scenario's tag is its requirement id, so the requirement-to-test matrix is generated from the
feature files rather than maintained beside them. A requirement with no tagged scenario shows up as
a gap in that matrix; that is the point of generating it.

## Evidence

Each gate produces one indexed evidence bundle, assembled by a single command, with a directory per
requirement row. Bundles are versioned and immutable once a gate has consumed them.
