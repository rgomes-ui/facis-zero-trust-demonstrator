Feature: Management plane and data plane separation — design conformance
  A regression check behind Annex A row ZT-55, which it does not prove. ZT-55 (SRS 3.3) states
  three acceptance criteria:
    "Management plane components not reachable from data plane (verified in network test)."
    "Separation enforced at both network policy and service mesh layers."
    "Architecture diagram clearly shows plane separation."
  The scenario below proves none of them against a running system. It proves that the
  specification in section 6 of the architecture document, from which the network test is
  written, is consistent and, but for the one gap the section declares itself (istiod's xDS port,
  which no row disposes yet), complete: every path from the data plane to the management plane
  is disposed at both the network policy layer and the service mesh layer, in agreement with its
  verdict, and no other management-plane destination is left without a disposition. That is the
  second criterion as the design states it. ZT-55 itself is its own pending scenario in
  plane-separation.feature; it is covered when the matrix is executed against a cluster.

  Scenario: The plane-separation matrix is complete and consistent at both layers
    Given the plane-separation section of the architecture document
    When the plane-separation conformance check runs
    Then it reports no row that breaks an invariant the section states
